## Technologies Used

Building this portfolio involved a variety of technologies, carefully chosen to deliver an optimal mix of efficiency and functionality:

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. I used React to create a single-page application (SPA), making the site fast and smooth.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development. Tailwind CSS helped me design a custom, responsive layout without writing tons of custom CSS.
- **Flowbite React:** An open-source library of Tailwind CSS components built with React. It provided me with pre-styled components like buttons, cards, and forms, speeding up the development process.
- **EmailJS:** A service that allows sending emails directly from the frontend without needing a backend server. I used EmailJS to integrate a contact form that sends messages to my email, ensuring I'm easily reachable.
- **Vite:** A modern frontend build tool that significantly improves the development experience. Vite's fast refresh and optimized build times made development a breeze.

## Development Process

1. **Planning:** Started with sketching out the design and layout, focusing on user experience and mobile responsiveness.
2. **Setup:** Initialized the project with Vite for React to benefit from its fast builds and hot module replacement.
3. **Design Implementation:** Utilized Tailwind CSS for styling, creating a custom theme that aligns with my personal brand.
4. **Component Development:** Developed reusable React components, employing Flowbite React for standard UI elements.
5. **Contact Form Integration:** Implemented the contact form using EmailJS, allowing visitors to send messages directly to my email without server-side code.
